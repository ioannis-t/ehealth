# E-Health

## Project Description

Our team, the **Steamakers**, is excited to participate in the **7th Panhellenic Open Technologies in Education Competition**, presenting our innovative project titled **E-Health**.

### The Problem

Access to healthcare is a fundamental right. However, in remote and hard-to-reach areas—such as islands, mountain villages, or sparsely populated regions—even basic medical services are difficult to access. The lack of medical staff, specialized infrastructure, and facilities hinders prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

### The Solution

We propose the development and implementation of a **robotic healthcare system** that functions as a mobile health unit. It will reach remote locations to provide basic health monitoring, first aid, and telemedicine services via hospital connectivity.

#### Features

The robotic system will be:
- Smart, autonomous or remotely operated.
- Equipped with:
  - **Health sensors** to monitor vital signs:
    - Body temperature
    - Heart rate
    - Blood pressure
    - Blood oxygenation
  - **Basic medical equipment** for first aid:
    - Essential medications
    - Antiseptics
    - Blood pressure monitor
    - Thermometer

#### Supported Capabilities

- **Live video connection** with doctors (via camera, microphone, speakers)
- **Real-time transmission** of medical data to specialized units (hospitals/clinics)
- **Guided emergency handling** with doctors assisting local individuals
- **Electronic health record** creation and updating
